# Road Safety: Comprehensive Analysis of DRIVERs Road Crash Data

## Overview
**DRIVERs** is the central database for road crashes across the Philippines. Various agencies, such as the PNP-Highway Patrol Group, LGUs from Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, and Metro Davao, as well as the Department of Health (DOH), contribute to this database. It is used by decision-makers across sectors such as transportation, urban planning, and road safety. The primary goal of the database is to monitor road accidents and assess the effectiveness of existing public policies in reducing casualties and mortality rates.
