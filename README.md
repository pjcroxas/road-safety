# Road Safety: Comprehensive Analysis of DRIVERs Road Crash Data

## Overview

**DRIVERs** is the central database for road crashes across the Philippines. Various agencies, such as the PNP-Highway Patrol Group, LGUs from Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, and Metro Davao, as well as the Department of Health (DOH), contribute to this database.
